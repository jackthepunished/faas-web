         v7 of the plugin ships the compiler's own analyses. They are correct
         in the abstract, but they flag the deliberate "latest ref" pattern
         (`ref.current = prop` during render) that `store.tsx`, `build-log`,
         and the shader hooks all use on purpose to avoid re-subscribing an
         effect on every render. That pattern is load-bearing here, and each
         site is already commented explaining why. Warnings, so a genuinely
         new instance is still visible without failing the run.
