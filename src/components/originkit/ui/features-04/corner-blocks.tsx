/**
 * Figma "Group 2147240570" (2356:186 / 2356:197 / 2356:475) and its partner
 * (2356:191 / 2356:202 / 2356:415) — the eight filled cells that zig-zag down
 * the top of the grid.
 *
 * Each group is four squares of #ededed at 80% opacity stepping column to
 * column on every row, which is exactly two columns by four rows of the
 * background grid — so the group is laid out as that grid, cells sized to the
 * rule pitch (34.996 + 0.67 on phone, 52 + 1 above it), instead of four
 * absolutely placed squares.
 *
 * Both groups are measured from the ruled band rather than from the frame
 * edges, and they follow it wherever it goes — centred through tablet, pinned
 * to the left dot bar on desktop. Anchoring them to the frame instead would
 * walk them off their rules the moment the window is not exactly the Figma
 * width. Inside the band the pair starts 286.42 / 319 / 54 in and stands
 * 178.34 / 425 / 1008 apart, which is a whole number of rules every time.
 *
 * Phone and tablet mirror the two groups; desktop does not — there the right
 * group repeats the left one's step, so the second column is the one that
 * leads on both sides.
