/**
 * Figma "Mask group" (2356:132 / 2356:284 / 2356:422) — the dotted column at
 * each frame edge.
 *
 * Figma builds each one as a mask: a field of 12,810 rounded rects masking a
 * solid black bar. The rendered result is therefore just that bar dissolved
 * into 10% black dots, so it is rebuilt here as a tiled background rather than
 * shipped as the flattened 4MB SVG — same pixels, no asset, and it stretches
 * to any height.
 *
 * The bar widens 41 -> 51 -> 71 across the frames while staying flush to the
 * edges (~1.5px in on the left, a hair past 100% on the right). The dot field
 * is the same 12,810 dots every time, so a taller frame does not add rows, it
 * stretches them: the horizontal pitch stays 4.5277 throughout and the
 * vertical one goes 7.2514 -> 6.2024 -> 5.1584. The dot keeps the same share
 * of its cell at every size, which is why one tile serves all three and only
 * the background-size changes.
 *
 * Figma also stops the bars short of the frame bottom, which only reads as a
 * fade-out because of the dead space down there; with that space gone they run
 * the full height instead and keep their ~9px overhang at the top.
